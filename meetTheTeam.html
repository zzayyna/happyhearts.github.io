  <h1>SARAH KAMDEM ❤️</h1>
  <h3>BLOSSOM</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sarah Kamdem, and I’m a 16-year-old rising senior in high school. I am from Cameroon, but I go to boarding school in Massachusetts, USA. In my spare time, I like to bake, read and play tennis. As a high school student who has now started the college process, I recognize how consuming our individual goals can become, and thus the importance of remembering to take a break. My daily skincare routine is my mandatory daily self care time. While taking care of my skin, I get to listen to music and reflect on my day. Although I try to exercise, eat healthy and meditate on a regular basis as well, I find that my skincare routine is the one element of my self care routine that I am able to keep consistent even things gets overwhelming. I decided to create this website to help remind myself and others of the importance of self care, as well as to aid in destigmatizing the issue of mental health. I hope that this website can be a source of love and guidance to whoever needs it!</p></div>

  <h1>DANIS IOANA ❤️</h1>
  <h3>BUBBLES</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Hello everyone! My name is Danis Ioana, I am 16 years old, and I am a rising junior in high school. I live in Romania, and I am passionate about fashion and everything related to clothes. I really enjoy going thrifting and putting together new outfits. In my free time, I love to go for quiet walks with my dogs. I equally enjoy hiking, cooking and playing badminton. As part of my self care routine, I try to take care of my skin and body on a daily basis, and I try incorporating the things I like — such as watching movies and vlogs to relax — in my schedule, even when my life gets busier than usual. I wanted to create this website to remind people how important it is to take care of themselves, as I think many people tend to underestimate the importance of self care.

  <h1>ZAYNA SAYYED ❤️</h1>
  <h3>BUTTERCUP</h3>
  <br>
  <p> Hi! I’m Zayna, and I’m a 17-year-old Pakistani-American curretly living in Saudi Arabia, and a rising junior in high school. I love art and anything to do with being creative, and also enjoy music, making jewelry, journaling, and coding! In fact, I hope to pursue a major in computer science! To take care of myself everyday, I try to balance my work with my interests, and take breaks whenever I need. I also find huge comfort in creating lists to organize my thoughts and plans. But with school, college planning, and other priorities, I sometimes find myself struggling to organize my time – but I hope to practice improving this problem and finding more time to take care of myself while still getting these things done. That’s why I wanted to create this website – because I know I’m not alone in this. I know there are many people who are under tons of stress and it can truly affect their mental health, so I hope that our website can be a source of guidance and self-improvement; and I hope I can benefit from this too <3
