And we don’t even have to think about it! We’ve been blessed with this superpower, so it’s our job to take whatever steps we can to keep our body functioning properly. By keeping our bodies healthy, we have the potential to enjoy our lives and do amazing things!

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ WATER ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Our body is 60% water, and every day, we lose fluid in urine, sweat, and even breathing! With water being one of the most vital aspects of our life, we need to make sure we are drinking enough of it everyday.</b>
</p> </center>
</div><br>

<div class="tips">

<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ DIET ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Eating a healthy diet is all about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood. It protects you against many chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats are essential for a healthy diet. Good food = good mood!</b>
</p> </center>
</div><br>

<div class="tips">

</div>
</div>

<br><br><br>
  
<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ EXERCISE ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Exercise has endless benefits! It strengthens your heart and improves circulation, reducing the risks of heart diseases; it boosts energy, blocks negative thoughts and distracts you from daily worries; and the more obvious one — it helps you burn calories! Moreover, research shows that physical activity boosts self-esteem, mood, and sleep quality — basically everything we’re trying to achieve here. Exercise is key!</b>
</p> </center>

</div>

<br><br><br>
  
<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ SLEEP ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>To put it simply, sleep is vital. Sleep is necessary for your mind and body to recharge, and the consequences of continued sleep deprivation go far beyond mere fatigue and irritability. Some of the most serious potential problems associated with chronic sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Moreover, sleep is a luxury often taken for granted by many. 50 – 70 million people in the USA alone suffer from insomnia. If you are able to sleep well, be thankful that you can.</b>

</p>
</div>

<div class="tipBox">
  <h1>TIP #3</h1>
  <p>Log off your phone at least 15-30 mins before bed; screen time right before bed has been proven to disrupt sleep quality.</p><br><br><br>
</div>

<br><br><br>
  
<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ SKINCARE ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Taking good care of your skin is important for more than just your appearance. As the largest organ you have, your skin is essential to your general health. Although the effects of a good (or not)  skincare routine may be negligible when you are younger, the effects are much more visible and irreversible once you get older. This is why it is so important to have a well-thought-out skin care routine. Skincare is like an investment in yourself —you’ll reap the benefits as you age!</b>
