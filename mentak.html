  <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">MENTAL WELLNESS</h1>
  &nbsp;
  <p>There is a lot that goes into your mental health and when it is properly taken care of, it can help you cope with stress, work productively, make better choices, and live better overall lives. Mental health is not a condition that just develops overnight ,your mental health affects how you think, feel, and act – and it can impact the people around you. With that in mind (no pun intended), let’s learn to become aware of our mental health and how we can practice improving it. Below are some things we would love for you to try. Enjoy!
</p>
&nbsp;
  </div><br><br><br>

<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 45px;">❤️ SELF REFLECTION❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Self-reflection is an essential skill for personal growth. Without it, we walk around unconscious and often reactive to others and even our own selves. If you have ever had an emotional response to something or blurted out words that you later regretted, you can see how self-reflection might assist you in choosing more healthy responses and changing behaviors (even thoughts) that aren’t working well for you! If we take the time to better understand ourselves and who we are, we may find ourselves living happier and more satisfied!

<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ RELAXATION ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Relaxation is an important part of maintaining health and well-being and being able to calmly deal with life’s stresses.  It improves your mental health and gives the body a chance to take a break, releasing muscle tension (that you may not even be aware of), and lowering blood pressure. Massage, exercise, meditation,  reading books, craftwork, guided imagery, and yoga are all methods of achieving relaxation.  Choose something that you enjoy, that gives you a sense of satisfaction, and that you feel best relaxes both your body and mind.

<div class="point"><center>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">❤️ SOCIALIZATION ❤️</h2>
<p> <b>Socialization is the process of learning how to become part of a society. Through socialization, one learns the society’s unwritten codes of conduct, their role in life, and what is expected from them. Socialization occurs when one interacts with other people, and it is a very important process in the forming of personality - without socialization we have no commonly recognizable sense of self. Having a balance of alone time and social time can have profound impacts on our mental health!
